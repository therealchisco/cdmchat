# Multi-Client Server Implementation

- multiple_client_server_original.c
	The original implementation was taken from this [tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/socket-programming-in-cc-handling-multiple-clients-on-server-without-multi-threading/?ref=rp)
- multiple_client_chat.c
	This implementation takes the original code and instead of mirroring the input to every user, creates a two-client chat server.
